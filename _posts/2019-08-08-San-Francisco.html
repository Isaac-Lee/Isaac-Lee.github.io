<h2 class="section-heading">What we can do. What we have to do</h2>

<p>Dazzling sunlight, the first greeting from San Francisco. Unlike the first greetings, San Francisco was quite cold at the end of the day. On the way back to the hotel, I told the Uber driver that it was queit cold, and the Uber driver said that San Francisco had no real summer. Anyway. It seems like it's just a blog. I should stop. (I actually deleted two paragraphs.)</p>

<p>The purpose of our visit to San Francisco is training. So….. I want to share what I have seen and felt.</p>

<p>On the second day, I met incumbent developers at Adobe and Google. When Adobe developers introduced Adobe products, they heard that they had enterprise customer care software. I was the first to hear. Machine learning and data management / analysis are key technologies. The AI field is now a red ocean, and I thought it would be a skill that everyone in the developer's career would have. At Google, I could feel that I could not eat and live with only one well. I heard that “a solid foundation is the foundation of the developer.” As a student of computer science and engineering, I looked back at whether I had neglected the basics.</p>

<p>The conference that influenced the sentence “What we can do, What we have to do.” Is the subject of this post. Putting 1 at 50:50 to make 51:49, I was able to get my own “1” that makes a small but big difference like the conference's motto. What can we do in this age and what should we do?</p>

<p>What abilities do we have to survive in this fast-changing age, where technology that has lasted for a year now has become “great”? “Adaptability”, the ability to adapt quickly to new environments, is the ability that “rapid change” requires. And “many experiences,” which include both successes and failures, but has a requirement. It should be a learning experience that moves me forward. For many of these experiences, the "environment" is also important.</p>

<p>The 51 Conference, which gave me a new perspective on the world, and the post-conference workshop, not mentioned above, with Google developers, from Product Deisign to Buisness Pitch. Thank you for making my first college student summer vacation full.</p>

<p>I would like to participate again if I have this opportunity. I want to go meet new people and feel the joy of communicating.</p>
